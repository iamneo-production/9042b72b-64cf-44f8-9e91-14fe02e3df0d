    <p class="card-text" style={{fontSize:20,fontFamily:'inherit',backgroundColor:'white'}}>I met Krishil Soni through Jeevansathi last year on 22 April 2022. It started as an arranged marriage and ended up being a love marriage. Liked him at the first instance and we began a lifelong journey of love and togetherness. It is like a dream come true for both of us. To all the single people out there, we would advise you to keep things simple and real. Good luck with finding the right partner like I did. Thanks, Jeevansathi for helping me find my soulmate.</p>

It all started on December 2021, where my Dad has sent request to Mr.Gaurav Pandey as he had liked his profile and wanted to have further conversation. As Mr.Pandey has accepted the request, My father had called him and they kept on talking for continuous 2hrs. I would like to appreciate Jeevansathi for giving us an opportunity and a platform to connect so that we can share our lives together.</p>

    <p class="card-text" style={{fontSize:20,fontFamily:'inherit',backgroundColor:'white'}}>We met in 2020 October after 2 years exhaustive search for partner. I was there on Jeevansathi for two years and for once it felt that I would never find the kind of partner I am looking for. And boom, he just appeared. My cousin sister(Priyanka) use to handle my account. She connected with him and in no time we understood that this is it. His profile was simple not all drama about exaggerating about himself. That made me curious to get to know him more.</p>
