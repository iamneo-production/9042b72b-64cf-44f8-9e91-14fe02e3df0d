    <p class="card-text" style={{fontSize:20,fontFamily:'inherit',backgroundColor:'white'}}>We met at a cafe for coffee and lunch. We were both clear about our goals and expectations from life and partner. We found the comfort to be able to discuss everything at length where the date went on for 8 hours. Surjeet was traveling back to Australia soon and we managed to meet 2 more times. The compatibility was strong and we continued talking for 2 months. Meanwhile our families did their bit of background check and all went well there. With everything falling in place we decided to go ahead and get married.</p>
